            <ol> 
                <li class="no-1"> In a large bowl, 
                    mix ground beef, 
                    onion powder, salt 
                    and pepper until just 
                    combined. Do not over mix, or 
                    your patties will be tough.
                </li>
                <li class="no-2">Divide into six portions and form patties,
                     without pressing too hard. 
                     They should be uniform in thickness. 
                     Smooth out any cracks using your fingers. 
                     Make these right before you grill them, 
                     so they stay at room temperature.
                </li>
                <li class="no-3">Preheat your grill, 
                    grill pan or cast-iron 
                    skillet to high heat 
                    and add burger patties. 
                    If using a grill, 
                    cover with the lid.
                </li>
                <li class="no-4">Cook until the crust that 
                    forms on the bottom of the 
                    burger releases it from the 
                    pan or grate — about 2 minutes. 
                    Gently test, but don't flip it 
                    until it gets to this point. 
                    When burgers lift up easily, flip, 
                    add two slices of cheese to each, close lid if
                     using a grill, and cook on the other side for
                      another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare.
                </li>
                <li class="no-5">Remove burgers with a 
                    sturdy metal spatula and 
                    transfer to a plate. Allow 
                    to rest for several minutes, 
                    then transfer to buns.
                </li>
                <li class="no-6">Garnish as desired 
                    and serve immediately.
                </li>
            </ol>
