             <h4><strong>*</strong>ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                  <li>400g block firm tofu</li>
                   <li>3 tbsp cornflour</li>
                    <li>½ tsp garlic granules</li>
                    <li>½ tsp smoked paprika</li>
                    <li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
                    <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>* steps to make one.</h4>
             <ol>
                <li>Drain the tofu, 
                    wrap in 4-5 sheets of 
                    kitchen paper, put on a 
                    plate and put something 
                    heavy over the top, like 
                    a wooden chopping board, 
                    or a tray with a few tins 
                    on it. Leave for 20 mins to 
                    drain the excess moisture from 
                    the tofu.
                </li>
                <li>Mix the cornflour, 
                    garlic, paprika, 
                    salt and pepper in a small bowl. 
                    Unravel the tofu from the paper, 
                    cut in half through the centre, 
                    then cut into triangles, cubes or strips.
                </li>
                <li>Toss the tofu pieces in the spiced 
                    cornflour to coat all over. 
                    Heat the oil in a large non-stick 
                    frying pan over a medium-high heat. 
                    Fry the tofu for 2-4 mins on each 
                    side until golden, crunchy and browned at the edges. 
                    Smaller cubes will take 2 mins each side, larger 
                    triangles will take 4 mins. Cook in batches 
                    if you need to, adding a little more oil if 
                    the pan gets dry.
                </li>
                <li>Drain the cooked tofu on kitchen
                     paper and season with a pinch 
                     more salt before serving.
                    </li>
             </ol>
