                <li class="no-1"> In a large bowl, 
                    mix ground beef, 
                    onion powder, salt 
                    and pepper until just 
                    combined. Do not over mix, or 
                    your patties will be tough.
                </li>
                <li class="no-2">Divide into six portions and form patties,
                     without pressing too hard. 
                     They should be uniform in thickness. 
                     Smooth out any cracks<span class="block">using your fingers. 
                     Make these right before you grill them, 
                     so they stay at room temperature.</span>
                </li>
                <li class="no-3">Preheat your grill, 
                    grill pan or cast-iron 
                    skillet to high heat 
                    and add burger patties. 
                    If using a grill, 
                    cover with the lid.
                </li>
                <li class="no-4">Cook until the crust that 
                    forms on the bottom of the 
                    burger releases it from the 
                    pan or grate — about 2 minutes. 
                    Gently test,<span class="block">but don't flip it 
                    until it gets to this point. 
                    When burgers lift up easily, flip, 
                    add two slices of cheese to each, close lid if
                     using a grill,<span class="block2"> and cook on the other side for
                      another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare.</span>
                </li>
                <li class="no-5">Remove burgers with a 
                    sturdy metal spatula and 
                    transfer to a plate. Allow 
                    to rest for several minutes, 
                    then transfer to buns.
                </li>
                <li class="no-6">Garnish as desired 
                    and serve immediately.
